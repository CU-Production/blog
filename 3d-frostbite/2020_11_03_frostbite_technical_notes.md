## "Move to One Engine"

EA is moving its games, including Mass Effect and FIFA, [onto a single graphics engine][5]. Frostbite has evolved to become the cornerstone of these titles:

 * `FIFA` (FIFA 17/18)
 * `Mass Effect` (Mass Effect: Andromeda)
 * `Battlefield` (Battlefield 1 - 2016)  
 * `Need for Speed` (NEED FOR SPEED 2017: PAYING IT BACK)
 * `Mirror's Edge` (Mirror's Edge Catalyst - 2016)
 * `Star Wars` (Star Wars Battlefront) 
 * `Dragon Age` (Dragon Age: Origins)
